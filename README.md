# Selection-Sorting-Algorithm-Verilog
This project focuses on the hardware implementation of the selection sorting algorithm using Verilog within the Xilinx Vivado environment. Selection sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning (or end) of the sorted portion.
